# Air-Quality-Analysis-Tool-In-Cpp

This project is a C++-based command-line application for analyzing and visualizing air quality data. It allows users to process data from a CSV file and perform various operations to gain insights into air quality trends and patterns.

Features
1. Data parsing and storage: The application reads air quality data from a CSV file and stores it in memory using custom data structures.
   
2. Statistical calculations: Users can calculate average values for temperature, relative humidity, and absolute humidity for a specified month.
   
3. Data retrieval: The application allows users to retrieve data for a specific date and time, as well as the highest values for temperature, relative humidity, and absolute humidity for a given month.
   
4. Data visualization: Users can display data that exceeds the average values for a specified month, providing insights into air quality trends.
   
5. Menu-driven interface: The application offers a user-friendly menu-driven interface for easy interaction and data exploration.

Testing
The project includes a set of test cases to validate the functionality of different components. To run the tests, uncomment the runTests() function call in the main() function and recompile the code. The test results will be displayed in the console.
